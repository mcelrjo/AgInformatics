### Calculating the nth prime number.

Do you ever sit around and wonder what the 100th prime number is?  Or the 87th prime number?  You could just keep a static list of prime numbers sitting around but that would be a finite list.  What you really want is something dynamic that can calculate any prime number, at any time.  Right?  Of course you want that.

Remember that a prime number is any integer that is only divisable by 1 and itself.  This is a problem that is ripe for a Python function.  

You want to create a function that takes an integer as an argument and finds, starting at the first prime number, that prime number as if it were in a list.  

Computers are incredible machines that can do millions of calculations per second storing lots of data to solve the problem  So don't think like a person solving this problem.  A person is bounded by their speed and memory.  Instead, remember the near limitless (at least for this problem) computational power at your finger tips.
