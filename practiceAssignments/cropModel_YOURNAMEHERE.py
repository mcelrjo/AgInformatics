'''Below is a outline of an object oriented program you must complete.  It is a
class called hectareCrop.  hectareCrop is meant to model a given crop with
common variables of a crop -- how much rainfall it receives, how much N is lost, 
the yield of the crop, etc.  At the bottom are unit test that run to determine 
if you have implemented each class function correctly.
